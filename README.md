# Prediction-with-Regression
In the dynamic landscape of data-driven decision-making, predictive modeling through regression analysis has emerged as a powerful tool. This project focuses on leveraging regression techniques to predict two metrics: Salary Expectation based on Years of Experiences and Delivery Time based on Sorting Time. 
Through a comprehensive exploration of the datasets and the application of regression models, we aim to uncover valuable insights, optimize predictions, and contribute to informed decision-making in the respective domains.
The project is expected to be completed over a period of 1 weeks, including data collection, preprocessing, model development, and optimization.
This journey through Prediction with Regression for Salary Expectation based on Years of Experiences and Delivery Time based on Sorting Time, it holds the promise of uncovering valuable insights that can guide strategic decisions, enhance business operations, and contribute to organizational success. Let's embark on this exploration of data-driven prediction and its transformative potential.
